title: See Also Annotation

## `@SeeAlso`

{% include req-ver.md version="3.0.0" %}

The `@SeeAlso` annotation may be applied to classes and provides a see also section that will be included in
[Help](../help/) as an additional section.

To use it simply add it like so:

```java
@SeeAlso(
     internalCommands = { "my-cli my-other-cmd"},
     externalCommands = { "grep" }
)
public class MyClass { }
```

There are two fields, `internalCommands` and `externalCommands` each take a string array where one/more relevant
commands are listed.  The intent is that the former is used for referencing other commands within your CLI and the
latter for commands provided by the OS, other software etc.

In terms of help rendering the practical difference is that commands listed in `internalCommands` array are listed prior
to commands in the `externalCommands` array.
