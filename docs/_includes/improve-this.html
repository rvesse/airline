    I am not a professional technical writer and as the developer of this software I can often make assumptions of
    knowledge that you as a user reading this may not have. Improvements to the documentation are always welcome, if you
    have suggestions for the documentation please submit pull requests to the <code
        class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch.
