This is an example Module Path safe resource.  It is placed into the
package com.github.rvesse.airline.examples which matches the module
name declared for the module in which it is packaged.  This is necessary
because of how the JVM locates resources when running with the Module
Path.

Note that as seen in the module-info.java for this module you will still
need to explicitly open this package.  For resources the JVM applies
a stricter requirement that the package containing the resources is
unconditionally opened.

For scenarios where this isn't possible see the Discussions section.
