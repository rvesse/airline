As of Airline 3.0.0 new variants of some Help related annotations allow for
help to be separated out into external resources.  This allows content like 
this to be more naturally managed rather than being shoe-horned into 
annotations.

An empty line denotes a new paragraph.  We can have as many paragraphs as we want.

This resource was referenced by a @ExternalDiscussion annotation.  There are also
@ExternalProse, @ExternalExitCodes, @ExternalExamples and @ExternalTabularExamples
annotations which provide other help sections via external resources.

By default, external resources are located via the Classpath, Module Path or the
File system but the annotations allow for users to customise how the resources are
located via Airline's ResourceLocator abstraction.  In particular when using Airline
on the Module Path, i.e. a JPMS context, you have to be careful about how resources
are packaged into your module, see the prior Modular Resources section for notes on
that.

However, if following those restrictions isn't possible you may find it necessary to
take an additional dependency on the airline-jpms-resources module and explicitly
configure the JpmsResourceLocator as an additional locator.

External resources need to be parsed into suitable data for use with Airline's 
HelpSection system.  The default parser copes with simple text documents for 
prose like content e.g. this, and tabular content formatted as CSV.  There is also
a TabDelimitedHelpParser that can be used if tabular content is formatted as TSV
instead.  Or if you want to provide your external help in some other structured
format you can supply your own implementation of the relevant parser interfaces.
