# Airline - Change Log

### 3.x Deprecation

Future releases will start to focus on the 4.x builds which include some important new features e.g. first class
positional argument support, better DI framework integration, that are not possible under 2.x/3.x without making
breaking changes.  You can see progress on 4.x by following the `4x` branch and its `CHANGELOG.md` and `Migrating.md`
files.

### 3.2.0

- Type Conversion improvements:
    - When converting to types `DefaultTypeConverter` now considers overloads of `valueOf()`, `fromString()` and
      constructors that take a `CharSequence` argument
- Code Modernisation
    - Applied a variety of code modernisation PRs (#136, #138, #140, #143) (thanks to @khmarbaise)
- Build Cleanup
    - The Maven Plugin build dependencies were updated to avoid warnings during the build process (#152) (thanks to
      @khmarbaise)
    - Various other build warnings eliminated (thanks to @khmarbaise)
- Dependency Updates
    - Apache Commons Lang upgraded to 3.18.0 

### 3.1.0

This is a maintenance release to bring dependencies up to date and switch over to the new Maven Central publishing 
process due to Sonatype sunsetting support for the old OSSRH publishing process.

- Dependency Updates
    - Apache Commons Collections upgraded to 4.5.0
    - Apache Commons Lang upgraded to 3.17.0
    - Classgraph upgraded to 4.8.179
    - Various build and test dependencies upgraded to latest available

## 3.0.0

- Core Improvements
  - First class support for `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` as numeric types
  - First class support for `Path`
  - Provided corrected spelling for `ConvertResult.wasSuccessful()`, old mis-spelt method preserved but marked as
    deprecated
  - Added a `JpmsResourceLocator` as an additional `ResourceLocator` to allow finding resources when running in a JPMS
    context (requires additional module `airline-jpms-resources`)
  - **BREAKING** - Only `@AirlineModule` is used as a composition annotation by default, use of the older
    `@javax.inject.Inject` or `@jakarta.inject.Inject` annotations **MUST** now be explicitly configured.
- Help Improvements
  - Added an `@SeeAlso` annotation to Airline Core (#51)
  - **BREAKING** - `airline-help-bash` has moved `@BashCompletion` annotation into
    `com.github.rvesse.airline.annotations.help.bash` to avoid package collisions between this module and the core in
    order to allow this module to become a JPMS module
- Fluent API Improvements
  - A `ParserBuilder` created by calling `withParser()` on a `CliBuilder` can now return control back to its parent via
    the `parent()` method for cleaner Fluid CLI definitions
- Dependency Updates
  - **BREAKING** - Minimum JDK Version is now 11
  - Apache Commons Collections upgraded to 4.4
  - Apache Commons Lang upgraded to 3.14.0
  - `jakarta.inject` and `airline-backcompat-javaxinject` were made `optional` so will no longer be pulled in
    automatically
  - Various build plugins updated to the latest available versions (this only impacts developers building the library 
    from source)
  - Added new `airline-help-external` module with a dependency on Apache Commons CSV 1.10.0
  - Added new `airline-jpms-resources` module with a dependency on 
    [ClassGraph](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph) to enable resource location when Airline is used on Module 
    Path i.e. JPMS runtime context
- Maven Plugin improvements
  - Some logging has moved up to INFO from DEBUG, so you no longer have to use `-X` to see it
- New `airline-prompts` module provides a Fluent API for defining user prompts (#92)
  - Prompt timeouts so non-interactive apps don't hang forever
  - Configurable prompt sources
  - Configurable prompt formatting
  - Prompt for keys, strings, passwords, options (from a pre-configured list) or a strongly typed value
  - Integrates with Airline's type conversion
- New `airline-help-external` modules provides new help annotations that allow more complex help to be provided via
  classpath/file resources rather than directly in the annotations.  This is a generalisation of the mechanism already
  used by `@Version` annotation. (#52)
  - Adds `@ExternalDiscussion` `@ExternalProse`, `@ExternalExitCodes`, `@ExternalExamples` and
    `@ExternalExamplesTabular` annotations
- Build and Release Improvements
  - All Airline modules are now fully fledged JPMS modules meaning they can be used on the JVM Module Path instead of
    the Classpath where preferred
    - See `airline-examples` module for examples of constructing a `module-info.java` that pulls in other Airline
      modules and see `modularExample` script for examples of invoking an Airline based app using the Module Path

### 2.x Deprecation

3.0.0 is now released, so Airline 2.x will no longer be supported.

## 2.9.0

- Build Improvements
   - Added GitHub Actions based CI/CD for the repository
   - Added a new `airline-backcompat-javaxinject` module to aid Annotation Improvements (see below), this is
     included in the dependencies of the core `airline` module by default.  Note that future 3.x releases may
     make this dependency optional as the Java ecosystem transitions away from using the old `javax` packages.
- Annotation Improvements
   - Added `@AirlineModule` as future replacement for existing usage of `@Inject` 
   - `@Inject` can now be either `javax.inject.Inject` or `jakarta.inject.Inject`, and mixtures thereof are
     supported.  This enables broader compatibility with applications that need/want to use either variant of
     the standard Java `@Inject` dependency.
- Parser Improvements
   - Choice of composition annotations is now configurable.  Defaulting to supporting the new `@AirlineModule` 
     annotation, and for backwards compatibility both variants of the `@Inject` annotation as noted above.
       - Use `compositionAnnotationClasses` field with the `@Parser` annotation
       - Use `withCompositionAnnotations()` or `withDefaultCompositionAnnotations()` with the `ParserBuilder`

**NB:** The changes to injection annotations have been carefully done to be fully backwards compatible with existing
Airline annotations for the 2.9.x releases.  Future minor and major releases will change the default behaviour to
**only** support `@AirlineModule`.  Therefore, you may wish to start migrating your applications to using this
annotation sooner rather than later and explicitly exclude legacy dependencies.  See the [Migration
Guide](Migrating.md#excluding-inject-dependencies) for more details on this.

## 2.8.5

- Restriction Improvements
    - New `@RequiredUnlessEnvironment` restriction for making an option/argument required only if one/more 
      environment variables are not set
- Stopped generating the airline-offline-site artifact as it is superflous

## 2.8.4

- Restriction Improvements
    - New `@NoOptionLikeValues` restriction for explicitly rejecting values that look like options i.e. start with
      `-` or `--` but didn't match a defined option e.g. user typos (#112)

## 2.8.3

- Parser Improvements
  - Added a `GreedyMaybeListValueOptionParser` to cover more cases where greedy parsing behaviour is desired (#110)


## 2.8.2

- Bug Fixes
  - Fix for some option parsers being overly greedy for arity=1 options and incorrectly consuming subsequent options
    (#110)
    - For most users the change should have no impact other than more reliable error reporting.  For users who rely
      heavily upon `ClassicGetOptParser` you may notice the removal of this greediness.  If you wish to retain the old
      behaviour configure your option parsers to include the new `GreedyClassicGetOptParser`.


## 2.8.1

- Bug Fixes
  - Fix for using Airline in JPMS environments (#102) (thanks to @jfallows)

## 2.8.0

- Core Improvements
  - `@Option` annotation now allows an array of values for the `title` field allowing options with `arity` > 1 to have
    distinct titles shown for each value the option accepts


## 2.7.2

- Bug Fixes
  - `@AllowedEnumValues` incorrectly provides help hint that values are case insensitive when they are actually case
    sensitive (#100)
  - `@AllowedRawValues` does not handle case insensitive mode correctly (#100)
  - `@Option` with `type = OptionType.GLOBAL` and `type = OptionType.GROUP` are not correctly parsed at the command
    level (#101)


## 2.7.1

- Bug Fixes
  - `CollectAll` handler collected multiple duplicates of the same error when certain restrictions were used.  Now
    instead duplicates are combined into a single exception (#94)
  - CLIs could allow command classes with the same declared command name in their `@Command` annotation to silently
    override each other.  Now instead an error will be thrown reporting the problem (#95)
  - When using group default commands and command abbreviation we can incorrectly ignore a value (#99)

## 2.7.0

- Bug Fixes
  - `EnvVarLocator` and `JvmSystemPropertyLocator` could resolve locations incorrectly if some placeholders were
    undefined
  - Fixes some corner cases with `@FloatRange` and `@DoubleRange` underlying implementation
  - Fix possible NPE in maven plugin (#45)
- Restriction Improvements
  - Added `@File` and `@Directory` as more explicit variants of `@Path` (#73)
  - Added `@Negative` and `@Positive` for numerics (#73)
  - Added `@LengthRange` and `@ExactLength` for strings (#73)
  - Added `@AllowedEnumValues` as a simpler way of specifying `@AllowedRawValues` on enum typed fields (#73)
  - Added `@StartsWith` and `@EndsWith` for enforcing prefixes/suffixes on strings (#73)
- Build Improvements
  - Provide `module-info.java` available so modules can be used on Module Path (#92) - Thanks to
    [jfallows](https://github.com/jfallows)

## 2.6.0

- Core Improvements
  - Allow creating a `Cli` instance with an explicit `ParserMetadata` for situations where parser configuration cannot
    be specified via annotation e.g. using dynamically determined paths for user aliases
  - Abstract direct usage of `System.out` via `Channels` factory interface to allow the library to be used in
    environments that are not consoles (#78) - Thanks to [sdorra](http://github.com/sdorra/)
- Parser Improvements
  - Allow `./` as a user alias search location resolved as the current working directory
  - Allow extending how user alias search locations are resolved to support custom behaviours via new `ResourceLocator`
    interface
  - Add ability to specify a force prefix for aliases which allows alias definitions to override built-ins while still
    being able to invoke those built-ins (#72)
  - Add ability to specify default values for positional parameters in alias definitions (#69)
- Help Improvements
  - Remove deprecated methods from `CommandUsageGenerator` interface and add new `usage()` overload for more easily
    generating usage for single commands
- Annotation Improvements
  - Allow specifying global restriction annotations directly on classes used with `SingleCommand`
  - `@Unrestricted` can now be applied directly to classes to specify no global restrictions on single commands and CLIs
  - `@Version` can now use `ResourceLocator` to modify search locations
  - Help Sections annotations can now be placed onto `@Cli` annotated classes and will be inherited by all commands
    defined for the CLI.  Commands can still override help sections as desired. (#59)
    - CLI defined help sections are included by CLI help generators (#57)
- Build Improvements
  - Now possible to build with JDK 9 and JDK 10.  Note that we still compile for JDK 7 compatibility
  - Dependencies
    - Upgraded Apache Commons Lang to 3.7 (#82)
    - Upgraded Apache Commons Collections to 4.2 (#82)

## 2.5.0

- *NEW* - Added `airline-maven-plugin` that provides two goals (#45)
  - A `generate` goal for generating help for your commands and CLIs during a Maven build
  - A `validate` goal for validating that your `@Command` and `@Cli` annotated classes have valid annotations that
    Airline can generate a CLI from

## 2.4.1

- Parser Changes
  - `ListValuesOptionParser` now accepts any number of values that are a multiple of the arity of the option so can now
    be used for options that wish to allow multiple values in a single list
- Documentation Improvements
  - Documentation website now located in `docs/` subfolder of `master` branch (#35)
  - New `airline-docs-VERSION-offline-site.zip` and `.tar.gz` artifacts contain a static build of the documentation
    website for offline reference (#70)
- Core Improvements
  - Removed some unnecessary helper methods from `AirlineUtils` in favour of JDK built-ins (#64)
- Help Improvements
  - Fixed some issues with UsagePrinter not correctly respecting configured column limits in some cases

## 2.4.0

- Bug Fixes
  - Fix bug in `@MutuallyExclusiveWith` error message (#66) - Thanks to [GTarkin](http://github/com/GTarkin/) for
    reporting
  - Fix bug with `flagNegationPrefix` specified via annotation - Thanks to [rkhaja](https://github.com/rkhaja) for the

    - Support for customising type converter on a per-option/arguments basis (#54)
- Help Changes
  - Added `showHelpIfErrors()` method to `HelpOption` for use with error handlers which collect errors e.g. `CollectAll`
    (#53)
- Annotation Changes
  - New `errorHandler` field on `@Parser` annotation for specifying error handler, defaults to `FailFast` for backwards
    compatible behaviour (#53)
  - New `flagNegationPrefix` field on `@Parser` to allow specifying that if a flag option (zero arity option) name
    starts with that prefix the value should be set to `false` as opposed to setting flags to `true` as is the normal
    behaviour (#63)
  - New `description` field on `@Pattern` to provide human readable explanation of regular expression restriction intent
    (#48)
  - Noted in Javadoc that `@Version` supports both properties and Manifest files as data sources (#56)

    - Variety of built in converters provided for supporting more complex number formats
      - Alternative Bases: `Hexadecimal`, `Octal` and `Binary`
      - Abbreviations: `KiloAs1000`, `KiloAs1024`

## 2.2.0

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a possible infinite loop in parsing when a group contains both sub-groups and commands (#55)
  - Fixed possible non-deterministic ordering of option and arguments help hints (#50)
- Annotation Changes
  - Removed deprecated `arity` from `@Arguments`, the `@MaxOccurrences` restriction annotation (and its related
    annotations) provide for much finer grained control than this property did
  - Global restrictions can now be specified via annotations
- Help Changes
  - Removed the deprecated RONN help generators (use `airline-help-man` or `airline-help-markdown` instead)
    - This removes the `airline-help-ronn` module (**Breaking**)
  - New `@Version` annotation for embedding version information into generated help where the version information is
    pulled from properties files in your JARs or on the local file system
  - Multi-page help generators can now be configured with a base directory to control where the per-command files are
    created
- Restriction Changes
  - New `GlobalRestrictionsFactory` interface and corresponding registry in `RestrictionsRegistry`
    - Uses `ServiceLoader` for automatic discovery, provide a
      `META-INF/services/com.github.rvesse.airline.restrictions.factories.GlobalRestrictionFactory` file to specify
      global restriction factories
  - Global restrictions can now be specified by adding annotations to `@Cli` annotated classes
  - Improved `OptionRestriction` and `ArgumentsRestriction` interfaces
    - Old `postValidate()` method becomes `finalValidate()`
    - Revised `postValidate()` method with better type signature that takes the converted value
  - Support partial restrictions i.e. restrictions only apply to some of the values for `@Option` or `@Arguments` fields
    - Specified via `@Partial`/`@Partials` annotations in addition 
- Parser Changes
  - Improve how restrictions for options and arguments are enforced
  - Options must always receive precisely their `arity` in values or a `ParseOptionMissingValueException` is thrown (at
    least with the built-in parsers)

## 2.1.1

- Bug Fixes
  - `ManCommandUsageGenerator` could incorrectly indent the arguments portion of the options list if both visible and
    hidden options are present

  - New website in progress at [http://rvesse.github.io/airline/](http://rvesse.github.io/airline/)

## 2.1.0

- Module Additions and Changes
  - New `airline-help-man` module
    - `ManSections` moved into this module (**Breaking**)
  - RONN help generators moved to `airline-help-ronn` module (**Breaking**)
    - All RONN generators are marked as `@deprecated` since they are superseded by the Man and Markdown format
      generators
  - HTML help generators moved to `airline-help-html` module (**Breaking**)
  - Bash help generators moved to `airline-help-bash` module (**Breaking**)
    - `CompletionBehaviour` moved into this module (**Breaking**)
  - New `airline-help-markdown` module for generating Markdown help
- Help Improvements
  - New direct man page generation via `ManCommandUsageGenerator`, `ManGlobalUsageGenerator` and
    `ManMultiPageGlobalUsageGenerator` provided in the `airline-help-man`
    - These are intended to replace use of the existing RONN generators for generating Man pages
  - New direct Markdown generation via `MarkdownCommandUsageGenerator`, `MarkdownGlobalUsageGenerator` and
    `MarkdownMultiPageGlobalUsageGenerator`
    - These are intended to replace use of the existing RONN generators for generating Markdown help
  - `CommandUsageGenerator` has new overloads that take a `ParserMetadata<T>` object, old overloads are deprecated in
    favour of these.  This allows generators to produce more accurate help in some circumstances.
  - Switched to using `ServiceLoader` to discover available help section factories avoiding the need to explicitly
    register these with `HelpSectionRegistry`
    - Provide a `META-INF/services/com.github.rvesse.airline.help.sections.factories.HelpSectionFactory` file to specify
      help section factories
    - `HelpSectionRegistry` moved to package `com.github.rvesse.airline.help.sections.factories` (**Breaking**)
    - `HelpSectionFactory` now required to implement a `supportedAnnotations()` method to declare the annotations it can
      turn into `HelpSection` instances (**Breaking**)
  - New `@Copyright` and `@License` annotations for adding copyright and license statements to help
  - New `@ProseSection` annotation for adding a custom prose section to help
  - Improved presentation of help hint for options/arguments annotated with `@Port`

    of their respective numeric types and the range is inclusive
  - Improved presentation of help hint for single value ranges
- Metadata Changes
  - User alias configuration are now preserved on a `UserAliasesSource<T>` class which is accessible via
    `ParserMetadata<T>.getUserAliasesSource()`
  - `completionBehaviour` and `completionCommand` are no longer fields on the `@Option` and `@Arguments` annotation.
    Instead use the `@BashCompletion` annotation from the `airline-help-bash` module
- Restriction Improvements
  - New `@Path` restriction for specifying that an arguments value is a path to a file/directory and applying
    restrictions on the path/file that should be enforced e.g. must exist, readable etc.
  - New `@MutuallyExclusiveWith` restriction for specifying that only one of some set of options may be specified but
    that those options are optional, this is thus a less restrictive version of `@RequireOnlyOne`
  - Switched to using `ServiceLoader` to discover available restriction factories avoiding the need to explicitly
    register these with the `RestrictionRegistry`
    - Factories are now required to implement a method indicating what annotations they can translate into restrictions
      (**Breaking**)
    - Provide a `META-INF/services/com.github.rvesse.airline.restrictions.factories.OptionRestrictionFactory` file to
      specify option restriction factories
    - Provide a `META-INF/services/com.github.rvesse.airline.restrictions.factories.ArgumentsRestrictionFactory` file to
      specify argument restriction factories

    that value should be at least the given length
- Documentation
  - Add missing Javadocs to new annotations

## 2.0.0

2.0.0 represents substantial breaking changes over 1.x which were made to make the library more configurable and
extensible.  We **strongly** recommend reading the included `Migrating.md` for notes on how to migrate existing Airline
powered CLIs forward.

- Dependency Changes
  - Removed Guava
  - Added Apache Commons Collections 4
- Builder improvements
  - All parser related options on `CliBuilder` are now moved to `ParserBuilder` which is access by calling
    `.withParser()` on the `CliBuilder` instance
  - Groups now support sub-groups and `GroupBuilder` provides `withSubGroup()` and `getSubGroup()` for working with
    these
- Annotation Changes
  - Various fields were removed from existing annotations in favour of moving them to separate annotations
    - `@Command` removes `examples`, `discussion`, `exitCodes` and `exitCodeDescriptions`
    - `@Option` removes `required`, `allowedValues` and `ignoreCase`
    - `@Group` can now be used to create sub-groups by inserting spaces into group names e.g. `@Group(name = "foo bar")`
      creates a group `foo` with a sub-group `bar` and applies any other configuration given to the sub-group
    - New `@Cli` annotation can be used to define a CLI entirely declaratively
    - New `@Parser` annotation can be used to customise parser for CLIs created with `SingleCommand` or as a field on a
      `@Cli` annotation

    - Custom extended help sections can be created and registered such that they are automatically discovered by Airline
  - New restriction annotations for expressing restrictions on options and arguments
    - `@Required` to indicate required options/arguments, this replaces the `required` field on the `@Option` and
      `@Arguments` annotations
    - New `@RequiredOnlyIf` for conditionally requiring an option if another option is present
    - New `@RequireSome` for requiring at least one from some set of options
    - New `@RequireOnlyOne` for requiring exactly one from some set of options
    - `@AllowedRawValues` for limiting the raw string values an option can receive, this replaces the `allowedValues`
      and `ignoreCase` fields on the `@Option` annotation
    - New `@AllowedValues` for limiting the converted values an option can receive
    - New `@MaxLength` and `@MinLength` for limiting the length of the raw string values an option can receive
    - New `@MinOccurrences`, `@MaxOccurrences` and `@Once` for limiting how many times an option can appear
    - New `@LongRange`, `@IntegerRange`, `@ShortRange`, `@ByteRange`, `@DoubleRange`, `@FloatRange` and `@LexicalRange`
      for indicating that arguments once converted to the appropriate value type must fall within a given range
    - New `@Port` for restricting options to some port range(s)
    - New `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for requiring the raw string values be non-empty or non-blank (not all whitespace)
    - New `@Pattern` for requiring that the raw string values conform to some regular expression
    - New `@Unrestricted` to indicate that restrictions inherited from an overridden option should be removed
    - Custom restrictions can be created and registered such that they are automatically enforced by Airline
- Parser Improvements
  - `TypeConverter` is now an interface and configurable i.e. allows you to control how Airline turns raw string values
    into Java objects
  - Option parsing styles are now fully configurable (default behaviour remains as 1.x which uses the first 3 styles):
    - Classic GNU Get Opt Style
    - Long GNU Get Opt Style
    - Standard whitespace separated style
    - List value style i.e. `--name a,b,c` for higher arity options
    - Pair value style i.e. `--name a=b` for arity 2 options
    - Users can define and register their own custom option parsers as desired
  - Alias Improvements
    - Can now support optional alias chaining i.e. aliases can reference other aliases

  - Parsing specific metadata moved to `ParserMetadata` class which is accessible via
    `GlobalMetadata.getParserConfiguration()`
  - `GlobalMetadata` is now a generic class taking the command type as the type parameter
- Help Improvements

  - New `HelpSection` interface for adding custom help sections to commands
  - More advanced and flexible formatting of extra help hints and sections in all existing generators
  - Help supports providing help for sub-groups, help for groups will include information about available sub-groups

## 1.0.2

    long descriptions
- CLI Improvements
  - User defined command aliases are now supported
  - CLI builder classes are now public and have their own `builder` package
  - Parser Improvements
    - All parser errors in the `parser` package have public constructors
- Help Improvements
  - Help generators can now optionally display hidden commands and options
  - `Help.help()` static improved:
    - Respects command abbreviation when enabled
    - Additional overloads for enabled output of hidden commands and options

  - `HelpOption` improved:
    - Generated help will include program and group name where applicable
    - It can now be used to show help with an arbitrary usage generator

    - Includes basic text decorations e.g. bold, underline

## 0.9.2

    - An `arity` can now be specified to set the maximum arity for arguments and throws a
      `ParseTooManyArgumentsException` if too many arguments are seen
  - New `DefaultOption` annotation
    - Allows a field already annotated with `@Option` to also be marked as the default option under certain
      circumstances.  This allows one option to be specified arguments style i.e. the `-n` or `--name` can be omitted
      provided only one field is annotated this way, it has an arity of 1 and no fields are annotated with `@Arguments`

    scripts
- CLI Improvements
  - CLIs can now have command abbreviation enabled which allows users to only type part of the command name provided
    that the portion typed is unambiguous
  - CLIs can now have option abbreviation enabled which allows users to only type part of the option name provided that
    the portion typed is unambiguous
